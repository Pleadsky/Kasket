# There's a problem...
**What's the problem?**
- You have to do it **within** the actual
  Windows terminal and in the location of
  the kasket.bat file.

**How to fix it?**
- Had to do a little switcharoo
# Status
**DONE!**
The .kasket files have to be in the
same directory as the kasket.bat file.
- OR you could just open the kasket.bat
with a shortcut with the .kasket files
in that directory. The Python file still
has to be in the same directory as
the kasket.bat, otherwise it won't work.
